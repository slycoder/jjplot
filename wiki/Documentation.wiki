= Introduction =

jjplot is intended to be a replacement for ggplot2 written entirely in base graphics.  The hope is that it will be fast and functional.  Note that semantics may be slightly different that ggplot2 in places.

*ggplot2 is still _way_ more functional than jjplot, so take comparisons with a grain of salt*

= Installation =
Simply download the source from the "Source" tab above.  In R, all you need to do is `source("jjplot.R")` and you're ready to go.  See jjplot.test.R (or documentation below) for example usages.

= Todo =
I will add functionality as I need it.  Here is the short list:

  * Numeric color scales
  * Expose methods to set title and axis titles/labels
  * geom_fill or geom_tile
  * Faceting into multiple graphs
  * Legends
  * scale_size
  * manual color scales
  * scale_shape

= Concepts =
The workhorse function of jjplot is `qplot.fast`, which takes the following formals:

{{{
  qplot.fast(x = NULL, y = NULL, data = NULL, alpha = NULL, color = NULL, ...)
}}}

  * `x` - An expression to map to the x-axis.
  * `y` - An expression to map to the y-axis.
  * `data` - A data frame in whose context expressions will be evaluated.
  * `alpha` - An expression to map to the alpha channel.
  * `color` - An expression to map to the colors of each element in the data frame.  This expression must evaluate to a factor; colors will be chosen automatically for each factor and mapped to appropriate plot elements.
  * `...` - Statistic and geometry functions to apply to the data.

After the mapping performed by named arguments, each statistic and geometry function is successively applied.  Statistic functions can be understood as transformations of the data: they take a data frame, compute statistics over that data, and produce a new data frame.  Geometry functions take the data frames output by statistic functions and display them graphically.

= Examples =
{{{
df <- data.frame(x = rnorm(10000) + (1:4) * 1,
                 f = factor(c('A', 'B', 'C', 'D')))
df$y <- 1:4 * df$x + rnorm(10000)
}}}

{{{
> qplot.fast(x, f, data = df,
             alpha = 0.10, color = f,
             qplot.jitter(yfactor = 1, xfactor=1),
             qplot.point()))
}}}

This function will first set x values to the numeric column `x` in the data frame. 
The y values will be set to the factor `f`.   Color will also be associated with `f`. 
The points are jittered along both the x and y axis, and then these jittered points are plotted as a scatter plot.   This visualization is a richer version of a boxplot.

{{{
> qplot.fast(x + 2, y, data = df,
             alpha = 0.10, color = f,
             qplot.point(),
             qplot.facet(qplot.fit(), facet = f),
             qplot.abline(),
             qplot.fun.y(mean),
             qplot.hline(lty = "dashed")))
}}}

This function will set the x values to `x + 2` and the y values to the `y` column in the data frame.  Once again, points will be colored according to `f`.   The first `qplot.point()` will then plot these as a scatter plot (because of the implicit identity statistic).  The next statement applies a least-squares fit to each subset of the data defined by `f`, and the following line draws lines corresponding to these fits.   Finally, the last two lines compute the mean y value of all the points in the data frame and draws a dashed horizontal line at the mean value.

== Statistics == 
  * `qplot.identity` - Returns the original data unchanged.  *This statistic is implicitly called as the first statistic*.
  * `qplot.fun.x(f)` - Computes a function `f` over the x margin of the data.  Outputs column `x` with the computed statistic. 
  * `qplot.fun.y(f)` - Computes a function `f` over the y margin of the data.  Outputs column `y` with the computed statistic. 
  * `qplot.fit()` - Produces a least-squares fit via `lm` over `y ~ x`.   Outputs columns  `a` and `b` for the slope and intercept of the fit.
  * `qplot.jitter(xfactor = 0, yfactor = 0)` - Returns the original data jittered by the amounts given as parameters.
  * `qplot.facet(f, facet)` - Calls the statistic function `f` on each subset of the data defined by facet `facet`.  Outputs the columns of `f` along with a column indicating the associated facet of each data point.

== Geometries ==
Note that many of these typical graphical parameters such as `lwd` and `lty`. 
  * `qplot.hline()` - Draw horizontal lines at positions given by the column `y`.  
  * `qplot.vline()` - Draw vertical lines at positions given by the column `x`.  
  * `qplot.abline()` - Draw lines with slope and intercept given by the columns `a` and `b`.  
  * `qplot.point()` - Draw points at positions given by `x` and `y` (i.e., a scatterplot).
