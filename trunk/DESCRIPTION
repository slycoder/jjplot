Description: jjplot is a plotting library inspired by ggplot2.  jjplot
	     is written in grid and while not yet as functional as
	     ggplot2, jjplot can quickly and easily produce beautiful
	     graphics including line graphs, scatter plots, bar
	     graphs, and boxplots.  jjplot also makes it
	     straightfoward to compute and overlay statistics and fits
	     onto graphs, and to facet graphs by factor via subplots
	     and automatic color scales.
